### Data Structures and Algorithms ###
​This repository contains problems related conditional statements in Javascript,  of Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript using Node.js environment.​

### Technologies used ###
Javascript (for coding algorithms)
Node.js (as a runtime environment)​

### Software needed to run this app ###
Node.js v14.1(to run my code) (use this command to find node's version: node --version)
VS Code (as a code editor)​
### How to run this app? ###
Go to main folder (for example: Data Structures and Algorithms folder here)
Now go to sub folders according to every topic (for example: Conditionals folder here)
Each folder contains a app.js file which consists of a problem with its solution
Problem is stated in the comments at top and then there's solution to the problem afterwards.
open cmd and write node app1.js to run this your desired JS file.​
